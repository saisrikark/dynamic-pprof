## Description

[pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof) is a tool to view resources used by go applications. <br>
To use it we must host a http server. <br><br>
Often to switch it on, users are forced to restart their application.
Resource consumption scenarioes are hard to replicate due to this restart. <br>
In general we would prefer not to host an extra server if not required. <br><br>
This package helps us to toggle on and off the pprof server without restarting. <br>
Some preexisting rules are provided which are implemented as part of an interface. <br>
